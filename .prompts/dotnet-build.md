> Base context from [copilot-instructions.md](../.github/copilot-instructions.md) is auto-included.

## Quick Prompts

**Reduce build time:**
```
Review the csproj files in src/ and suggest changes to reduce build time. Focus on incremental build improvements, parallelization, and removing unnecessary dependencies.
```

**Reduce output size:**
```
Analyze publish configuration for src/Web/Web.csproj. Suggest trimming, single-file, and AOT options appropriate for .NET 10. Show exact csproj property changes.
```

**Fix build warnings:**
```
List all build warnings in the solution and provide fixes. Prioritize by severity. Show exact code changes.
```
