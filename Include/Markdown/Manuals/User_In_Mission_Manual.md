# BriefingRoom for DCS World - User in mission manual
__Last Edited: 23/12/2021__

This manual contains everything you need to know to play a mission generated in BriefingRoom

**This manual is not complete yet, additional information will be added in future revisions.**

## Basic Flow
When you start the mission you will generally find there are no aircraft flying (Except AWACS if SKynet IADS is on). Neither are there any moving vehicles. Don't worry these will spawn when you take off. We do this to avoid stuff moving too far or running out of fuel before players are ready especially in MP.

Once one player takes off this mission starts. Over the minute or so aircraft will spawn this can involve friendly or hostile CAP. You are provided with audio and visual confirmed kill call outs these will be different if its a objective target or just target of opportunity. Completing an objective also gives a chance for friendly or hostile CAP to spawn in so get on the AWACS radio channel and stay alert.

When you complete all objectives you are told the RTB. This isn't mandatory and the mission won't end if you land so feel free to keep playing. You can get a updated mission status though the F-10 Commands.

## Knee Board

## F-10 Commands
Under Other in your radio you will find your interactive options for features within BriefingRoom this is explained below.

### Mission
Generally actions not linked to any specific objective
#### Status
Get the status of the mission and each objective is layed out like so

        Mission Still in Progress:
        [ ] Destroy all SAM sites at objective BAF (0/6) 

If an objective is complete it will appear as so

        [X] Destroy all SAM sites at objective BAF (6/6) 

The target count at the end of each objective line should give you idea of your progress towards completion. If you ask for status at the start it can be useful to decide if you want to change your payload to something more suitable.

#### Taskable
Aircraft and Artillery can be tasked but they need coordinates. To do this you create a mark on the map and title it as noted in the Remarks (in briefing and Knee Board)

Process is as so:

1. Create marker 
1. Name it "CAP" for example
1. Radio message confirms its seen
1. Use F-10 => Mission menu to call in CAP

Once spawned in aircraft can have its target location updated by just deleteing & createing a new marker then calling the radio again.

Artillery just has a limited number of shots

### Objective
#### Laser
#### Other
