# Custom Configs
__Last Edited: 11/01/2022__

Briefing Room (BR) allows you to create custom configs. For now (June 2022) this is limited to Coalitions.

The folder structure follows the same as in `Database` in the way that you should put your configs in the same relative place.

**Example Files have been provided, just change `.Example` to `.ini` to get working.**

## Coalitions

Adding custom coalitions has exactly the same format as the Coalitions found in `Database\Coalitions`.

Countries is a limited field and you should [these listed ones](https://github.com/akaAgar/briefing-room-for-dcs/blob/main/Source/BriefingRoom/Library/Enums/Country.cs)

Note you can overwrite a coalition but for now (Jan 2022) this will only overwrite the `Countries` field
